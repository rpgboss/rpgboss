* Make battle feel more responsive to player input.
* Restore charaters' HP and MP after battle (temporary hack).
* Indicate via battler display when a character is dead.
* Make animations for BattleDamage.

* Running "run" for the editor project in Sbt doesn't allow for test-playing the game.
* Make method that auto selects an element, asserting the collection is not empty. Use it in Battle.scala.
* Window management and input managment are not directly linked. ChoiceWindows add and remove themselves to both stacks. Investigate if we can tie them together.
* Make user interface for Effects behave correctly when there are multiple StatAdd fields.
